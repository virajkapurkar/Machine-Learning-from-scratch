# Machine-Learning

An attempt to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch (without using any ML/DL libraries like keras, tensorflow or pytorch)
The aim is to understand the underlying math for these machine learning algorithms.

Following machine learning algorithms have been implemented:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support vector machines
4. K nearest neighbours
5. Decision Trees (classifier)
6. Neural Networks
